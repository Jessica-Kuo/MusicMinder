# MusicMinder
List app for remembering that song you're going to listen to later

Android app requires APK 27+ to run
Built in Java

When you're walking around and hear a really cool song around you, you'd search it up, right?
But once you find the title, where do you save it?

**MusicMinder is where!**

This Android app uses Android Room (an abstraction on SQLite databases) to store entries for all of eternity (or as long as you want).

Current version lets users add new entries, delete them, and edit current entries.

*Based off of Google CodeLabs' tutorial on using Room databases*
